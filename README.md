# Hello World Test Repository

This repository is a sandbox for learning and experimenting with GitHub features. It contains a simple "Hello, world!" program in various programming languages. Use it to practice your Git workflow and explore the different functionalities offered by GitHub.

## Purpose

* **Learning Git:** Practice basic Git commands like cloning, committing, pushing, branching, and merging.
* **Exploring GitHub:** Get familiar with GitHub's interface, including creating repositories, issues, pull requests, and wikis.
* **Collaboration:** Learn how to collaborate with others on code projects through GitHub, by forking the repository, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

## Contents

* **hello_world.py:** A "Hello, world!" program in Python.
* **hello_world.js:** A "Hello, world!" program in JavaScript.
* **hello_world.java:** A "Hello, world!" program in Java.
* **hello_world.c:** A "Hello, world!" program in C.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world.git` (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)
2. **Make changes:** Add or modify files as needed. For example, try adding a new "Hello, world!" program in a different language.
3. **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m "Your commit message"` (Write a clear and concise message describing your changes)
4. **Push your changes:** `git push origin main`

## Exploring GitHub Features

* **Issues:** Create issues to report bugs, suggest improvements, or discuss ideas.
* **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests to propose changes to the codebase.
* **Wikis:** Use the wiki to document the project, create tutorials, or share information.
* **Branches:** Experiment with branching to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel.
* **GitHub Actions:**  Learn how to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code using GitHub Actions. (You can find a basic workflow example in the `.github/workflows` directory.)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by:

* Adding more "Hello, world!" examples in other programming languages.
* Improving existing code or documentation.
* Suggesting new features or ideas.
